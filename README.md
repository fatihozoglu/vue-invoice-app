# Vue Invoice App

This is the solution for [Frontend Mentor Invoice App](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/invoice-app-i7KaLTQjl). You can keep track of your personal invoices with this app. You can create a new invoice, save it as a draft or as pending, mark pending invoices as paid and edit any draft or pending invoices. Also you can filter the invoices by their draft/pending/paid status.

You can see the [live demo here.](https://fozoglu-vue-invoice-app.surge.sh/)

I am planning to build this as a Full Stack Web Application by adding a NodeJS/Expressjs server and Mongodb/Postgresql Database.

This project is built with:

- Frontend Framework: [Vuejs](https://vuejs.org/)
- Created with: [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/),
- For state management: [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/),
- For routing: [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/),
- For form validations: [Vuelidate](https://vuelidate.js.org/).

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, read, update, and delete invoices
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit an invoice
- Save draft invoices, and mark pending invoices as paid
- Filter invoices by status (draft/pending/paid)
- Bonus: I will add Nodejs/Expressjs backend when i finish this project to make it a Full Stack Web App.
